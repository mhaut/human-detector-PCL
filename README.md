Detecting people on a ground plane with RGB-D data

This tutorial aims at explaining how to detect people from RGB-D data with the pcl_people module. With the proposed method, people standing/walking on a planar ground plane can be detected in real time with standard CPU computation. This implementation corresponds to the people detection algorithm for RGB-D data presented in
